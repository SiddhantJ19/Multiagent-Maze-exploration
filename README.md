# Multiagent-Maze-exploration
Agent Based Modelling approach to model maze search using collaboration strategy among agents.
I've implemented 3 stratagoies to simulate a swarm of robots exploring unknown territory. The maps can be generated by the ```maze_generator.py``` in the maps folder. It also has 2 pre generated maps of size 30x30 and 70x70. Complete description of agents and strategies can be found in the info tab of the netlogo model

# Setup
1. Generate maze
    ```python3 maze_generator.py```
2. Create Maze-map file similar to ```map3-towers.txt```
3. Open netlogo 6.1 and import ```MazeExplorer.nlogo```
4. Import Map by clicking ```load-own-patch-data``` followed by ```show-patch-data```.
5. Follow the video tutorial

# Contribution
Make PR for following
- Automate maze-map generation directly from python script
- Refactoring code
- Add More search strategies
